# Personal Blog Website

## Purpose

I built this blog website in order to showcase my skills as a web developer, and to provide a place for myself and page visitors to make blog posts.
## Description and Usage

The home page displays a cover image for my blog along side basic website feature. On the right side of the body there is a form that visitors of the page can fill out with their information for a unique blog post. When the user clicks the post button, the content of the form is logged to local storage and used to populate the blog page. In addition to the form, there is also a "switch mode" button in order to toggle the page bwtween a light and dark mode.

On the main blog page, all of the previous post that have been made are listed. Each post is made its own section with a title, a message, and a username, all of which are provided by the poster on the form on the home page. These posts are populated from the local storage and are appened to the page via a script. In the header of the blog page there are two buttons. The "back" button returns the user to the home page where they can fill out the form again and make a new post. The "switch mode button does the same as the one on the home page and switches the display between a dark and a light theme.
